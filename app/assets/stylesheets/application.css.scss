 // Example using 'superhero' bootswatch

// First import journal variables
@import "bootswatch/superhero/variables";

// Then bootstrap itself
@import "bootstrap";

// Bootstrap body padding for fixed navbar
body {
  padding-top: 60px; 
  margin:20px;
  //background: url(/assets/page_bg.jpg) repeat;
}

// Responsive styles go here in case you want them
@import "bootstrap-responsive";

// And finally bootswatch style itself
@import "bootswatch/superhero/bootswatch";

// Whatever application styles you have go last
@import "base";
